            Muhammad Ali Jinnah
        </h1>
        <p >
            Muhammad Ali Jinnah (born Mahomedali Jinnahbhai; 25 December 1876 – 11 September 1948) was a lawyer, politician and the founder of Pakistan.[2] Jinnah served as the leader of the All-India Muslim League from 1913 until Pakistan's creation on 14 August 1947, and then as Pakistan's first Governor-General until his death. He is revered in Pakistan as Quaid-i-Azam ("Great Leader") and <mark>Baba-i-Qaum</mark>, ("Father of the Nation"). His birthday is considered a national holiday in Pakistan.[3][4]

            Born at Wazir Mansion in Karachi, Jinnah was trained as a barrister at Lincoln's Inn in London. Upon his return to British India, he enrolled at the Bombay High Court, and took an interest in national politics, which eventually replaced his legal practice. Jinnah rose to prominence in the Indian National Congress in the first two decades of the 20th century. In these early years of his political career, Jinnah advocated Hindu–Muslim unity, helping to shape the 1916 Lucknow Pact between the Congress and the <code>All-India Muslim League</code> , in which Jinnah had also become prominent. Jinnah became a key leader in the All India Home Rule League, and proposed a fourteen-point constitutional reform plan to safeguard the political rights of Muslims. In 1920, however, Jinnah resigned from the Congress when it agreed to follow a campaign of satyagraha, which he regarded as political anarchy.

                Throughout his life Jinnah never compromised on his dignity and integrity. Once when a grateful client tried to overpay him not only was he was duly refused but also returned the extra amount

                Honesty beyond doubt:
            </dt>
            <dd>
                Throughout his life Jinnah is never reported to have lied. Even in the last twenty years of his political struggle be it in roundtable conferences or Bombay talks, it was always the Nehruvian congress which backed out of agreements but never the Jinnah led Muslim League.
